# Windows MP3 Downloader Using Python

This personal project helped me to easily download any YouTube's video audio as a MP3 file.

### User Guide

To use the downloader on your system you just need to have Python and the [requirements](https://github.com/lucasgmalheiros/mp3-downloader/blob/master/requirements.txt) installed (run `pip install -r requirements.txt`), open Windows CMD 
or PowerShell on the directory where [yt_mp3.py](https://github.com/lucasgabriel21/mp3-downloader/blob/master/yt_mp3.py) is located and type as follows:

`py yt_mp3.py {link} -o {path-to-directory (optional)}`

You should insert the arguments without brackets and the path must be between quotation marks. If `py` do not work for you try `python` instead. 
When no directory is specified, the script automatically saves the MP3 to your Music folder.

It is also interesting to pack the Python program as a Windows executable (.exe) with packages like 
[_pyinstaller_](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5458048/how-can-i-make-a-python-script-standalone-executable-to-run-without-any-dependen), so the program can run on PCs that do not even have Python, and it is even better when you 
[add the executable file location to system path](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/), so you can call it from any Windows directory.

I will not share my .exe file because no one should ever run suspicious executables on their PC.

#### Example
```py yt_mp3.py https://youtu.be/fqsMCEgHMrE -o "C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\MP3 downloader"```

### Limitations and Thoughts

- It is still not possible to download playlists with this script;
- No option to also download the videos;
- It would be nice to search videos by name to download then without the need to open YouTube (potentially using a GUI to list options);
- It can be easily adapted to any OS just by changing the directory structure in the code.
